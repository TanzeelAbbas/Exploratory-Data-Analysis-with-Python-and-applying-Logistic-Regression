# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python-and-applying-Logistic-Regression
This project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python and applying Logistic Regression for classification. In this project we used various Python libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn, to analyze and visualize the data and build a Logistic Regression model.
